<p>The run_analysis.R contains five parts
The initial checking is done to ensure we are at the right working directory in which the data is placed
Libraries are then loaded in, the libraries in use are data.table and dplyr
</p>
* Part 1 contains steps to merge data from training and test sets into single dataset

* Part 2 contains steps to extract only data containing mean and standard deviation values for various measurements

* Part 3 contains steps to associate numbering used to the descriptive activity names
:LAYING, SITTING , STANDING,WALKING,WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS and WALKING_UPSTAIRS are the activity names respectively

* Part 4 is to replace acronyms with more readable forms of labels for measurements recorded

* Part 5 is to tidy the data and output it to Tidy.txt for further processing
